# Lab-06-product-pusher

## Goal

Today we will be starting a new project, with basic elements of
an e-commerce site including a product page and shopping cart. Decide your product domain and follow repository setup guide, giving your repository a relevant name related to the product.

---

## Learning Objectives
- Plan and implement a data model for a product
- Use a for loop to get access to every item in an array
- Use `document.createElement` to create DOM elements
- Dynamically create event listeners for multiple items without having to copy and paste code.
- Write, test, and use a function that takes in a product object and returns a DOM element for that product

---

## Standard Setup Process

1. Create a repo called `lab-06-e-commerce-site` on Github
    - make sure to click add a `README.md`
1. Copy the URL of the new repo
1. From the command line (terminal) clone your repo:
    1. `git clone <url>`
    1. **`cd` into your repo from the command line**
    1. `npx create-alchemy-bootstrap .`
    1. Launch vscode with `code .`

## Topic

Pick a real or fictitious product, up to you. You will ultimately need to come up with (at least) the following for each product:

Property | Description
---|---
`id` | a unique string that identifies this product
`name` | user friendly name of the product
`image` | image file name for this image (should live in `assets`)
`description` | a longer description of the product
`category` | the category this product belongs to, limit to one
`price` | the price the user will pay

## Pages

The primary focus today is the product page (`products`). However, you should slot in a simple home page (`index.html`), which should have a link to the product page.

You should also have `common/main.css` used by all pages, as well as a page-specific css page (like `products/products.css`).

## Product Page

The goal for today is to generate a list of products from product data.

### Step 1: Design List

Work out the static design for one product in your list. This will help you to flush out what data will be needed. Make sure to include an "Add" button whose value is the product `id`.

**git add, commit, push!**

### Step 2: Product Data

In a new JavaScript file, named by the domain (class example was `fruits.js`):

1. Write out object literals for each product, storing in a variable with same name as product `id`. These objects are key/value pairs whose values uniquely describe each product. All products should have _exactly_ the same keys!
2. Create a variable that is an array of all of your products
3. Export this array.

**git add, commit, push!**

### Step 3: TDD DOM Render Function

Write a test that passes a product to a function and asserts that the return dom with `.toOuterHTML` matches your static html example:
1. Copy html from the page
1. You will need to remove extraneous whitespace. Don't worry, you can adjust the test as need
1. Copy the object product data for the one that corresponds to the example, and use as your input to your function
1. Using the DOM API, create your static example _programmatically_
using JavaScript. Start by creating the top level element (`<li>` for the product list)
1. Make the test pass! (Again, you may need to adjust html syntax - pay close attention to test details)

**git add, commit, push!**

### Step 4: Generate Product List

In your `products.js`, you will need to:
1. import your data and your DOM generation function
2. locate the list element where your products will go
3. loop through your data
    1. Create a variable that is the singular of your domain list and assign based on the current array index. For example, `const fruit = fruits[i];`
    1. Pass to your DOM generation function and capture result in variable
    1. Append to the top-level list element

**git add, commit, push!**

## Points Break Down

Looking For | Points (10)
:--|--:
Hosted on GitHub with URL in About section, Product HTML works and uses good Semantic Element choices  | 2 
CSS used consciously and correctly | 1
Products Object Literals and Array of all Products | 2
TDD DOM Render Function | 3
Correctly orchestrate product generation in `products.js` using a for loop and your render function | 2
